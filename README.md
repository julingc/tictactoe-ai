## Project description

It is one of the projects for Harvard's online course **CS50â€™s Introduction to Artificial Intelligence with Python**. There are two main files in this project: `runner.py` and `tictactoe.py`. `runner.py` was implemented by the teaching staff, and contains all of the code to run the graphical interface for the game. In `tictactoe.py`, I implemented all functions except `initial_state`.
